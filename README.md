<!-- Description -->
This is a refactored version of the Horiseon marketing agency website. I made various changes to the html code to improve it without altering any existing functions. My changes included adding semantic elements, adjusting the headings so that they fall in sequential order, creating a concise descriptive title, creating alt attributes, and commenting in the CSS style sheet.
